# PawSwipe

I created this project to learn JavaScript (React and Express.js).  
It's a Tinder clone, but for pets.  

I initialized the database of this app with abandoned pets from the SPA (Société Protectrice des Animaux) website, a French animal protection organization.  
I wrote a Python script to scrape this data.
